DISCLAIMER
============

**UNMAINTAINED/ABANDONED FORK / DO NOT USE**

Due to the new EU Cyber Resilience Act (as European Union), even if it was implied because there was no more activity, this repository is now explicitly declared unmaintained.

The content does not meet the new regulatory requirements and therefore cannot be deployed or distributed, especially in a European context.

This repository now remains online ONLY for public archiving, documentation and education purposes and we ask everyone to respect this.

As stated, the maintainers stopped development and therefore all support some time ago, and make this declaration on December 15, 2024.

We may also unpublish soon (as in the following monthes) any published ressources tied to the corpusops project (pypi, dockerhub, ansible-galaxy, the repositories).
So, please don't rely on it after March 15, 2025 and adapt whatever project which used this code.





IMAPFilter

Description

  IMAPFilter is a mail filtering utility. It connects to remote mail servers
  using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), sends searching queries to
  the server and processes mailboxes based on the results. It can be used to
  delete, copy, move, flag, etc. messages residing in mailboxes at the same or
  different mail servers. The 4rev1 and 4 versions of the IMAP protocol are
  supported.

  IMAPFilter uses the Lua programming language as a configuration and extension
  language.
